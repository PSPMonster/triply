## 🐛 Known Issues (Be Ready to Answer)

### If Jury Asks About...

**"Is the AI real?"**
✅ Answer: "This MVP uses curated data to prove the concept. We're ready to integrate OpenAI—it's a one-day task. What matters is the UX, and that's fully functional."

**"How do you compete with Google/Airbnb?"**
✅ Answer: "We're not competing—we're creating a new category. Google shows 'what', we show 'how to feel'. It's complementary."

**"What's your moat?"**
✅ Answer: "Our emotional algorithm. We'll build proprietary data on what makes people feel calm vs. stressed in each city. That's defensible."

**"Is this scalable?"**

**"Who's your customer?"**
✅ Answer: "Millennials and Gen Z who prioritize experiences, value sustainability, and struggle with decision fatigue. 40% of the travel market."
