âœ… Static assets routing works!

This file is served directly by Vite dev server, NOT by React Router.

If you can see this, it means:
- /public/assets/ folder is correctly configured
- Vite serves static files from /public/ at root URL
- React Router does not intercept /assets/* paths

Next step: Add bg_video.mp4 and video-poster.jpg to this folder!
