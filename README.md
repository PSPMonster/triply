# 🧭 Triply - Intelligent Calm Travel Planner

> _Travel slower. Feel deeper. Discover more._

## 🌟 Concept

**Triply** reimagines the way we explore the world by combining **AI-powered personalization** with the emerging trend of **calm travel** (calmcations). Instead of overwhelming tourists with endless options, we create mindful, stress-free journeys that prioritize:

- 🌊 **Meaningful experiences** over tourist traps
- 🌱 **Eco-conscious choices** and sustainability
- 💆 **Mental well-being** and reduced travel stress
- 🎭 **Cultural immersion** with local communities
- ⏱️ **Slow travel** philosophy - quality over quantity

## 💡 The Problem

Modern travel planning is:

- **Overwhelming**: Too many choices lead to decision fatigue
- **Stressful**: Tight schedules and crowded attractions
- **Impersonal**: Generic recommendations ignore individual needs
- **Unsustainable**: Environmental impact often ignored
- **Surface-level**: Missing authentic cultural exchanges

## ✨ Our Solution

Triply is an **AI-powered travel planner** that creates personalized "calm routes" based on:

1. **Mood Detection** - Relax, Culture, or Adventure vibes
2. **AI-Powered Curation** - Smart itineraries with emotional insights
3. **Stress Metrics** - Noise levels, crowd data, eco-scores
4. **Mindful Pacing** - Built-in breaks and reflection time
5. **Local Connections** - Authentic experiences, not tourist traps

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

Inspired by **Apple's minimalist aesthetic** and the **Calm app's peaceful UX**:

- Clean, spacious layouts with generous white space
- Smooth, natural animations (Framer Motion)
- Emotional language and empathetic copy
- Focus on feelings, not just features
- Premium, polished experience

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19 + Vite
- **Router**: React Router v6
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Styling**: CSS Modules + CSS Variables
- **Geocoding**: Geoapify API (location search)

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
